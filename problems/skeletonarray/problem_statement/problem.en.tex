\problemname{Skeleton Array}
A hint of disarray permeates the air in the department of Bioinformatics at Link√∂ping University. 
Anatomy diagnostics reveal that the code skeleton, used in all of the department's lab series, has lost its
skeleton array implementation!

For an array $A$ of size $N$, define the \textit{skeleton array} of $A$, $S(A)$, as the array of differences between subsequent elements of $A$. 
More formally, $S_i(A) = A_{i} - A_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i < N$.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item{Example: \, $A = [A_1,A_2,A_3]$, $S(A) = [A_1-A_2,A_2-A_3]$}
%\end{itemize}

Given an array $A$, you are tasked with finding an array $B$ such that $S(B) = A$ and the absolute value of the sum of $B$ is minimum. If there are multiple solutions $B$, output the one where $B_1$ is maximum.
% $\mid \sum b |$



\section*{Input}
The first line of input consists of an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$), the size of the array $A$. The following line contains $N$ integers $A_1, A_2, ..., A_N$ with $|A_i| \leq 10^6$.

\section*{Output}
Output a single line of $N+1$ space separated integers representing the array $B$.
