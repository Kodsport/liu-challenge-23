\problemname{Choire of Birds}
In a large tree there is a choire of $N$ birds, one at each node. At any given node of the tree, the volume of the bird at node $i$ is $floor(A_i / (B_i + d^2))$, where $A_i$ and $B_i$ are constants and $d$ is the distance to the bird when walking along the branches. At which node of the tree is the total volume the loudest?

\section*{Input}
The first line contains a single number $N$ ($1 \le N \le ?$), the number of nodes in the tree. The $N$ following lines contain two numbers each, $A_i$ ($0 \le A_i \le ?$) and $B_i$ ($1 \le B_i \le ?$), the constants for node $i$ ($0 \le i \le N-1$). The $N-1$ lines following that contain two numbers each, $p_j$ and $q_j$, the nodes connected by edge number $j$. The graph does not contain a cycle.

\section*{Output}
A single number, the index of the node where the total volume is the loudest.

\section*{Test cases}
\textit{To do: Pick reasonable bounds for the following time complexities: $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, $\mathcal{O}(KN)$, and $\mathcal{O}(N \max \sqrt {A_i})$, where at most $K$ birds have $A_i > 0$.}
